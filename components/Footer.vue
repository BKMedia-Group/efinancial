        <strong>This plan is NOT insurance.</strong> This plan is not a
        qualified health plan under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Some services
        may be covered by a qualified health plan under the ACA. This plan does
        not meet the minimum creditable coverage requirements under M.G.L. c.
        111M and 956 CMR 5.00. This is not a Medicare prescription drug plan.
        Discounts on hospital services are not available in Maryland. The plan
        provides discounts at certain health care providers of medical services.

        services. The plan member is obligated to pay for all health care
        services but will receive a discount from those health care providers
        who have contracted with the discount plan organization. The range of
        discounts will vary depending on the provider type and services
        provided. The licensed discount plan organization is Coverdell &
        Company, Inc., at 2850 W. Golf Road, Rolling Meadows, IL 60008,
        1-800-308-0374. To view a list of participating providers, visit
