        <h2>Terms, Conditions and Disclosures</h2>
        <p>
          This plan is not insurance. This is your agreement as Cardholder with
          Coverdell & Company, Inc. (a "discount plan organization," "DPO"). It
          is effective on the date of acceptance of Cardholder’s application for
          enrollment in the Wellness Benefits Program (“Program”) and for the
          period of your plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          DPO shall provide Cardholder with a listing of participating
          providers. Cardholder shall excuse DPO from any liability for errors
          in such listings. Providers are subject to change without notice.
          Cardholder is responsible for choice of provider, verification that
          the provider is a current participant and for payment for goods and
          services. No portion of any provider’s fee will be reimbursed or
          otherwise paid by DPO. Cardholder is solely responsible for payment.
          Savings are based on the provider’s usual fees or on national or
          regional fees for the service or product. Actual savings will vary
          depending upon your location and the specific products or services
          purchased. Providers may offer certain products or services to the
          general public at prices lower than the Program price. In that event,
          members will always be charged the lower price.
          <span>This is a discount program and not insurance.</span>
          Program discounts cannot be used in conjunction with any other network
          based program.

          Participating providers are solely responsible for the quality of
          service or product purchased by Cardholder and DPO disclaims any
          liability with respect to such matters. DPO reserves the right to
          modify any benefits, including provider networks, included in Your
          Program. If your state requires that we notify you of changes to your
          benefits, DPO will do so.

          Payment of membership fee is made by the billing source authorized by
          you in accordance with the payment terms to which you agreed. DPO

          renewal membership term effective upon renewal of your membership. To
          change your method of payment, call the customer service number shown
          on the membership I.D. card. Membership is not transferable. For

          an individual plus one membership, only you plus one other individual
          may use the membership. For family memberships, only you and anyone
