        <p>
          This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) of Coverdell &amp; Company,
          Inc. (“We” “Us” “Our”) explains how We use Personal Identifiable
          Information (“Personal Information”) Users submit and how it is
          thereafter stored in the company’s database. In Our efforts to bring
          the customer (“Member” “You”) of the membership or other program (“The
          Program”) the Program in which You enrolled or requested information,
          We reserve the right to make limited use of basic personal information
          which You have agreed to provide to Us in connection with signing up
          and/or enrolling in the Program. You consent to receive periodic
          communications from Us and/or Our business affiliates regarding Your
          membership or inquiry, the Program and its benefits as well as consent
          to be contacted by Us or any third parties regarding other products or
          services that may be of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What information is collected?</strong> Generally, We gather
          Personal Information that You expressly provide when You sign up to
          receive information and/or enroll in the Program and collect
          information about your transactions with us or our affiliates. This
          information includes, for example, Your name, mailing address, e-mail
          address, and phone number or some other unique personal identifier
          that We can use to confirm sales and billing information (e.g. city of
          birth or mother's maiden name). Occasionally, We may request other
          information from You that may be used by Our Membership Services
          department to confirm enrollment, update Your account or confirm Your
          order and so that We can improve Our program and offerings. If You use
          one of Our websites, We may collect data regarding Your traffic and
          use of the site. When You visit Our websites, cookies are placed on
          Your hard disk which allows a computer to remember who You are and
          make Your return visits to the website more convenient. We recommend
          that You leave cookies turned onto take full advantage of some of Our
          site features though they are not required.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Who is collecting the information?</strong> The Program is
          owned, marketed and/or distributed by Coverdell &amp; Company, Inc.
          The information collected is owned by Us and/or Our marketing partners
          depending on who offered You the Program. Note that this Privacy
          Policy outlines only Coverdell’s policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do We use the information collected?</strong> We use the
          Personal Information You provide to Us to service Your Program
          membership and store in Our database to contact You about future
          Programs or other offers. For example, We request Your mailing address
          so We know where to send the Program Material and any other
          information You may request. We also may send You additional
          membership information such as updates about Our Program or other
          programs that may be of interest to You. We use Your credit card
          information to bill You for the membership fee. We may use Your email
          address to notify You of Program updates and to further provide You
          with additional product information and opportunities of membership or
          offers. The Personal Information that is collected may also be shared
          with other groups within the Coverdell organization, and with
          Coverdell’s affiliates and/or marketing partners depending on who
          offered You membership in the program. If Your Program involves the
          use of one of Our websites, the technical and statistical information
          that is automatically collected from Your computer whenever You visit
          Our website is used to help Us improve the site and the member
          experience. From time to time We may disclose general statistical
          information about Our website and its visitors such as the number of
          visitors, the number and type of products purchased, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Do you share personal information with third parties?</strong>
          We may share Personal Information You provide us and information about
          your transactions with third parties whom We employ to perform
          functions on Our behalf, and as permitted by law. For example, We use
          a third party to verify and process Your credit card information in
          order to charge You for Your Membership fee. All third parties are
          contractually obligated to use Personal Information only for the
          purpose for which it is given. We are not responsible for the
          information practices of third parties. The collection, use and
          disclosure of information by third parties are subject to their
          respective privacy policies, which may differ from Our policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          From time to time, We may also share Personal Information You Provide
          us and information about your transactions with Our affiliates and/or
          marketing partners or unaffiliated third parties who offer products
          and services We think will be of interest to You.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, limited customer information may potentially be
          transferred as a business asset of Coverdell & Company, Inc. As We
          continue to develop Our business, We may buy or sell assets. In such
          transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred
          business assets. Also, in the event that Our company or substantially
          all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be
          one of the transferred assets. In the event that customer information
          is transferred as described in this paragraph, members may be notified
          and have the ability to opt-out of having their personal information
          transferred to any new entity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do I change/modify my information?</strong> You can
          change, modify or update Your member information simply by calling the
          customer service number on Your membership card.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do you secure member information?</strong> Data Security
          is a critical issue for Coverdell. Credit card data is always
          protected during transmission between Our websites and administrative
          environment through the use of SSL technology. Once received at Our
          administrative center, data is encrypted, and access to data is
          protected through multiple controls and security practices in
          accordance with PCI standards. Coverdell is a PCI certified
          organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Internal access to member information is protected and can only be
          accessed by password. We also contract with industry experts to
          institute and review web and other security on a periodic basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do you update your Privacy Policy?</strong> We will notify
          You in advance if there is a material change in Our privacy practices.
          Additionally, We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy to Our
          websites if Your Program involves the use of a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How do I contact the Program or opt out?</strong> If You have
          any questions about the practices of this Program, Your dealings with
          any of Our websites, or to opt out of information sharing and be
          placed on Our Do Not Contact List, You can contact Us at
          1-800-308-0374.
        </p>
        <p>
