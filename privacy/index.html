        This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) of Coverdell & Company,
        Inc. (“We” “Us” “Our”) explains how We use Personal Identifiable
        Information (“Personal Information”) Users submit and how it is
        thereafter stored in the company’s database. In Our efforts to bring
        the customer (“Member” “You”) of the membership or other program (“The
        Program”) the Program in which You enrolled or requested information,
        We reserve the right to make limited use of basic personal information
        which You have agreed to provide to Us in connection with signing up
        and/or enrolling in the Program. You consent to receive periodic
        communications from Us and/or Our business affiliates regarding Your
        membership or inquiry, the Program and its benefits as well as consent
        to be contacted by Us or any third parties regarding other products or
        services that may be of interest.
      </p> <p><strong>What information is collected?</strong> Generally, We gather
        Personal Information that You expressly provide when You sign up to
        receive information and/or enroll in the Program and collect
        information about your transactions with us or our affiliates. This
        information includes, for example, Your name, mailing address, e-mail
        address, and phone number or some other unique personal identifier
        that We can use to confirm sales and billing information (e.g. city of
        birth or mother's maiden name). Occasionally, We may request other
        information from You that may be used by Our Membership Services
        department to confirm enrollment, update Your account or confirm Your
        order and so that We can improve Our program and offerings. If You use
        one of Our websites, We may collect data regarding Your traffic and
        use of the site. When You visit Our websites, cookies are placed on
        Your hard disk which allows a computer to remember who You are and
        make Your return visits to the website more convenient. We recommend
        that You leave cookies turned onto take full advantage of some of Our
        site features though they are not required.
      </p> <p><strong>Who is collecting the information?</strong> The Program is
        owned, marketed and/or distributed by Coverdell & Company, Inc.
        The information collected is owned by Us and/or Our marketing partners
        depending on who offered You the Program. Note that this Privacy
        Policy outlines only Coverdell’s policy.
      </p> <p><strong>How do We use the information collected?</strong> We use the
        Personal Information You provide to Us to service Your Program
        membership and store in Our database to contact You about future
        Programs or other offers. For example, We request Your mailing address
        so We know where to send the Program Material and any other
        information You may request. We also may send You additional
        membership information such as updates about Our Program or other
        programs that may be of interest to You. We use Your credit card
        information to bill You for the membership fee. We may use Your email
        address to notify You of Program updates and to further provide You
        with additional product information and opportunities of membership or
        offers. The Personal Information that is collected may also be shared
        with other groups within the Coverdell organization, and with
        Coverdell’s affiliates and/or marketing partners depending on who
        offered You membership in the program. If Your Program involves the
        use of one of Our websites, the technical and statistical information
        that is automatically collected from Your computer whenever You visit
        Our website is used to help Us improve the site and the member
        experience. From time to time We may disclose general statistical
        information about Our website and its visitors such as the number of
        visitors, the number and type of products purchased, etc.
      </p> <p><strong>Do you share personal information with third parties?</strong>
        We may share Personal Information You provide us and information about
        your transactions with third parties whom We employ to perform
        functions on Our behalf, and as permitted by law. For example, We use
        a third party to verify and process Your credit card information in
        order to charge You for Your Membership fee. All third parties are
        contractually obligated to use Personal Information only for the
        purpose for which it is given. We are not responsible for the
        information practices of third parties. The collection, use and
        disclosure of information by third parties are subject to their
        respective privacy policies, which may differ from Our policy.
      </p> <p>
        From time to time, We may also share Personal Information You Provide
        us and information about your transactions with Our affiliates and/or
        marketing partners or unaffiliated third parties who offer products
        and services We think will be of interest to You.
      </p> <p>
        Furthermore, limited customer information may potentially be
        transferred as a business asset of Coverdell & Company, Inc. As We
        continue to develop Our business, We may buy or sell assets. In such
        transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred
        business assets. Also, in the event that Our company or substantially
        all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be
        one of the transferred assets. In the event that customer information
        is transferred as described in this paragraph, members may be notified
        and have the ability to opt-out of having their personal information
        transferred to any new entity.
      </p> <p><strong>How do I change/modify my information?</strong> You can
        change, modify or update Your member information simply by calling the
        customer service number on Your membership card.
      </p> <p><strong>How do you secure member information?</strong> Data Security
        is a critical issue for Coverdell. Credit card data is always
        protected during transmission between Our websites and administrative
        environment through the use of SSL technology. Once received at Our
        administrative center, data is encrypted, and access to data is
        protected through multiple controls and security practices in
        accordance with PCI standards. Coverdell is a PCI certified
        organization.
      </p> <p>
        Internal access to member information is protected and can only be
        accessed by password. We also contract with industry experts to
        institute and review web and other security on a periodic basis.
      </p> <p><strong>How do you update your Privacy Policy?</strong> We will notify
        You in advance if there is a material change in Our privacy practices.
        Additionally, We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy to Our
        websites if Your Program involves the use of a website.
      </p> <p><strong>How do I contact the Program or opt out?</strong> If You have
        any questions about the practices of this Program, Your dealings with
        any of Our websites, or to opt out of information sharing and be
        placed on Our Do Not Contact List, You can contact Us at
        1-800-308-0374.
      </p> <p>
        By using any of Our websites, if applicable, You consent to the
        collection and use of information as it is disclosed in this Privacy
        Policy statement. You are obligated to immediately inform us if and
        when any telephone number You provided to Us changes or is no longer
        in use. If You do not agree We ask that You contact Us to opt out of
        information sharing and do not use Our site. Thank You.
